## Acknowledgements

The current development of the HCTTs package is possible thanks to a grant funded by [**UnitaryFund**](https://unitary.fund).

The development of the HCTTs package has been possible thanks to the funding of the [_Attract Consortium_](https://attract-eu.com) under the project [_Quantum Imaging for Tomography (QuIT)_](https://attract-eu.com/selected-projects/quantum-imaging-for-tomography-quit).

Further funding has been provided by [_AZIENDA ULSS 8 BERICA -
Vicenza - U.O._](https://www.aulss8.veneto.it) in order to continue the work, beyond its deadline, which has been afflicted by the [COVID-19](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) lockdown, preventing the collaboration with the Health Care partner.
